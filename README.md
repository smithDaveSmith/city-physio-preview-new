# CityPhysio — redesign concept

An **unofficial** redesign concept for [CityPhysio](https://www.cityphysio.ie/), a chartered
physiotherapy clinic at 1–2 Vesey Terrace, Main Street, Lucan, Co. Dublin.

This is not affiliated with or authorised by the clinic. Every page carries a visible banner saying
so, every page is `noindex, nofollow`, and `robots.txt` disallows all crawling.

---

## Running it

```bash
npm install          # only needed for `npm run verify`
npm run build        # -> docs/   (root-hosted, e.g. a custom domain)
npm run build:pages  # -> docs/   (GitHub project page, paths prefixed)
npm run serve        # http://localhost:8080
npm run verify       # headless Chromium audit across every page × 3 viewports
```

No runtime dependencies. `build.js` is plain Node with no imports beyond `fs` and `path`.
Playwright is a dev dependency used only by the verification script.

### How it's put together

```
src/data/*.json   All content. This is the only place to edit copy.
assets/           CSS, JS, favicon — copied verbatim into docs/
build.js          Generates 38 pages from the data
scripts/verify.js Audits the built output
docs/             Build output. Committed, so GitHub Pages needs no CI.
```

Adding a symptom region or a service means adding one object to a JSON file. The index pages,
cross-links, "treated through" rails, prev/next pagers and sitemap entries all follow automatically.

## What was verified, and how

Measured with headless Chromium at 375 / 768 / 1440 px across all 37 routes (111 page-loads):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Horizontal overflow | None on any route at any viewport |
| Broken internal links | 0 of 37 probed |
| Console errors | 0 (excluding blocked fonts — see limitation below) |
| `<h1>` per page | Exactly 1 on every page; no heading-level skips |
| Images without `alt` | 0 |
| Links with no accessible name | 0 |
| Unlabelled form fields | 0 |
| Skip link | Present and the first tab stop on every page |
| `noindex` | Present on every page |
| Contrast (WCAG AA) | All measured text pairs pass — lowest 5.57:1 |
| Tap targets | All activation targets ≥ 24 px |
| Mobile menu | Opens, traps focus, sets `aria-expanded`, closes on Escape |
| Reduced motion | Content renders fully visible; transitions ~0ms |
| Form | Rejects empty submit (4 fields flagged); on valid submit states plainly that nothing was sent |
| Home page weight | 4 requests, 57 KB own assets |

### Limitations — things NOT verified

- **Webfont rendering is unverified.** The build sandbox's proxy blocks `fonts.googleapis.com`, so
  every measurement above was taken with *fallback* fonts. Layout, spacing and contrast are verified
  under fallbacks and hold; Archivo / Source Serif 4 / IBM Plex Mono rendering has not been seen.
  **Check this first after deploying.**
- **No Lighthouse or axe run.** Neither tool was available. The contrast, heading, landmark, label
  and target checks above were implemented directly and are real measurements, but they are not a
  substitute for a full automated accessibility audit plus manual screen-reader testing.
- **No real-network performance numbers.** Load times were measured against localhost in headless
  Chromium. They say nothing about real-world performance.
- **No testing on real iOS Safari or Android Chrome.** Only Chromium's device emulation.

## What the owner needs to supply

Ordered by how much it matters.

1. **Confirm the opening hours.** The current site contradicts itself. The page body on
   `/contact-cityphysio-lucan` says Mon–Thu 08:00–20:00, Fri 08:00–18:00. The `<title>` and meta
   description on the *same page* say Mon–Thu 8am–9pm, Fri 8am–6pm, **Sat 9am–2pm**. Google shows
   the title version, so patients may be arriving on a Saturday to a closed clinic, or not booking
   an 8pm Tuesday slot that exists. This concept uses the narrower body hours and puts them in
   structured data. **Fix this before anything else, on the live site, today.**
2. **Clinical sign-off on the safety and rule-out wording.** The amber "When not to wait for
   physiotherapy" panel and the green "What it probably isn't" notes were written to follow HSE/NHS
   public guidance and the clinic's own text. A chartered physiotherapist must read and approve every
   one before this goes live. Rule-out lines are currently on 4 of 15 regions — extending them to all
   15 is the single highest-value content job on the site.
3. **Photography.** There is none. The current site uses stock sports photos (the About banner is
   literally `cityphysio-ie-fallback-rugby1.png`) and caricature illustrations of staff. This concept
   therefore uses **no photography at all** — the design is built to work without it. Commission:
   the shopfront on Main Street, the waiting area, two or three treatment rooms, the shockwave unit,
   a Pilates class in progress, and proper headshots of all seven physiotherapists. Until then, do
   not substitute stock.
4. **Staff credentials.** No qualifications, letters, CORU registration numbers or years in practice
   are published anywhere. For a clinic whose entire positioning is expertise, this is the biggest
   easy win available. Supply per physiotherapist: qualifications, ISCP/CORU status, postgraduate
   training, years in practice, and which body regions and services they each cover.
5. **Prices, or a clear statement of why not.** Only "Prices on request" (Tendon Clinic) appears
   anywhere. Patients weigh cost before booking. At minimum publish the initial assessment and
   follow-up fee.
6. **Appointment durations.** Only the shockwave session length (20–30 min) is published. The first
   appointment duration is unknown and has deliberately not been invented.
7. **Typical course length.** "Most people need between X and Y sessions" is the most direct possible
   expression of *"we promise not to waste your time"*. Supply a range.
8. **Legal pages.** Privacy & Cookies, Child Safeguarding and Patient Privacy exist here as stubs
   that preserve the URLs. The real text must be migrated verbatim and checked — legal wording is not
   something to paraphrase. (The live Privacy page would not load during research, so its content was
   never read.)
9. **Insurer permission.** Insurers are shown as typographic names, not logos, because the original
   logo files could not be licensed or verified. If you want logos back, confirm you have permission
   to use each mark.
10. **Decide about the blog.** Two posts, newest April 2021, one still carrying placeholder text and
    a `demo-blog-post-title-here` URL. Either commit to publishing or retire it and redirect `/blog`
    to the symptom guide.
11. **The shockwave efficacy claim.** The current site states "up to 90% of patients report pain
    reduction after 3 sessions" with no source. It is **omitted here**. Reinstate only with a citation.

## Content provenance

Everything on this site traces to a verified source. `src/data/*.json` carries `_note` fields
recording where each block came from, and `site.json` has an `unverified` block listing every fact
that is in dispute or absent.

Nothing was invented: no reviews, ratings, testimonials, prices, statistics, qualifications,
guarantees, client logos or locations. Where the clinic publishes no information, this site says
nothing rather than filling the gap.

**Sources:** cityphysio.ie (home, about, services, symptom-selector, approach, contact, bookings,
pilates, downloads, blog), the embedded Cliniko booking endpoint, and the ISCP "Find a Chartered
Physiotherapist" directory. The logo's exact brand colours (`#184090` blue, `#008850` green) were
sampled from the official logo PNG.

---

## URL migration map

Every URL worth keeping is preserved exactly. **No redirects are required** if the site moves to
any host that serves directory-style paths.

| Current URL | This concept | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `/` | Unchanged |
| `/about-cityphysio-lucan` | `/about-cityphysio-lucan/` | Unchanged |
| `/services-at-cityphysio-lucan` | `/services-at-cityphysio-lucan/` | Unchanged |
| `/symptom-selector` | `/symptom-selector/` | Unchanged |
| `/pilates-classes-at-city-physio-lucan` | `/pilates-classes-at-city-physio-lucan/` | Unchanged |
| `/the-cityphysio-approach-to-treatment` | `/the-cityphysio-approach-to-treatment/` | Unchanged |
| `/blog` | `/blog/` | Unchanged |
| `/contact-cityphysio-lucan` | `/contact-cityphysio-lucan/` | Unchanged |
| `/bookings` | `/bookings/` | Unchanged |
| `/downloads` | `/downloads/` | Unchanged |
| `/privacy-cookies-policy` | `/privacy-cookies-policy/` | Unchanged |
| `/child-safeguarding-statement` | `/child-safeguarding-statement/` | Unchanged |
| `/patient-privacy-document` | `/patient-privacy-document/` | Unchanged |
| — | `/symptom-selector/<region>/` × 15 | **New** |
| — | `/services-at-cityphysio-lucan/<service>/` × 9 | **New** |

The 24 new pages are additive: 15 body-region pages and 9 service pages, each one a long-tail landing
page ("neck pain physio Lucan", "shockwave therapy Dublin") that the current site has no equivalent
for. Submit a fresh sitemap after launch.

Two existing blog URLs are linked out to the live site rather than migrated, pending the decision
above. The two PDFs still point at `cityphysio.ie/s/…`; rehost them alongside the site at launch.

## Final platform options

Pricing checked October 2026 — **verify before committing**, these change.

| | Owner editing | Functionality | Maintenance | Migration | Recurring cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stay on Squarespace** | Familiar; no retraining | Everything already works; Cliniko embeds fine | Squarespace handles it | None | Existing plan |
| **Static (GitHub Pages / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages)** | Needs a CMS bolted on, or edits via JSON — not owner-friendly alone | Fastest; forms need a third party (Formspree, Netlify Forms) | Near zero | Already done — this repo | Free–€20/mo |
| **Static + headless CMS** (Netlify + Decap, Cloudflare + Sanity) | Good once configured | Full control | Low, but someone must own it | Moderate setup | €0–25/mo |
| **WordPress** (managed host) | Very familiar; large plugin ecosystem | Anything, via plugins | Highest — updates, security, plugin rot | Full rebuild | €15–40/mo hosting |

**Recommendation.** You do not need to decide now, and the content model here is portable to any of
them. But be honest about who will maintain it: a static site is the fastest and cheapest, and it is
the wrong answer if nobody at the clinic can edit JSON. If reception needs to change a class time
without ringing a developer, go static-plus-CMS or stay on Squarespace — and note that **most of the
problems found in the audit are content and configuration problems, not platform problems.** The
hours contradiction, the filename `alt` text, the missing page titles and the empty structured data
can all be fixed on Squarespace this week, without any rebuild.

## Design direction

**Selected: a clinical reference work.** Swiss grid discipline crossed with the visual language of
anatomical plates and medical handbooks — hairline rules as the structural device, numbered sections,
mono metadata labels, marginal notes, and a serif reading face for clinical prose.

The reasoning: CityPhysio's real asset is its *writing*. The Symptom Selector contains 15 regions of
genuine clinical explanation written by the physiotherapists themselves, and the clinic's positioning
is diagnostic straight talk — *"we will tell you what is wrong"*. It owns no photography. A design
that makes the writing the hero therefore fits both the positioning and the actual available content,
and it avoids the stock-photo hero that the current site relies on.

Two alternatives were developed and rejected: an interactive SVG body map (distinctive, but hostile to
keyboard and screen-reader users, cramped at 375px, and it buries the team, the corporate offering and
eight of the nine services), and a warm Scandinavian editorial treatment (approachable, but close to a
generic template and weaker on the diagnostic positioning).

**Colour** is drawn from the logo: `#184090` blue for structure and links, `#008850` green for action
and section numbering, on warm paper `#fbfaf7` rather than clinical white. Dark mode is supported.

**Distinctive features**, each doing a job no competitor site inspected during research was doing:

1. **The symptom index** — 15 regions in a scannable rule-separated table, each with a plain-language
   symptom line rather than an anatomical label, resolving to a page that ends in a booking link.
2. **"What it probably isn't"** — a rule-out line that demonstrates diagnostic discrimination before
   the patient pays a cent. This is promise #1 rendered as content design.
3. **One honest safety panel** — region-specific where it matters, telling people plainly when *not*
   to come to physiotherapy. This is promise #3, and it is the thing that makes a symptom tool
   trustworthy instead of a liability.

## Deploying

`docs/` is committed, so GitHub Pages serves it with no CI.

**Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch `main`, folder `/docs`.**

If the repository is a *project* page (`username.github.io/repo-name`), rebuild with the repo name as
the base path first, or asset paths will 404:

```bash
BASE="/your-repo-name" node build.js
git add docs && git commit -m "Build for project page" && git push
```

For a user page or a custom domain, plain `node build.js` is correct.

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` is included as an alternative if you'd rather not commit build output;
it sets `BASE` from the repository name automatically. Leave it disabled otherwise.

**Do not deploy this to cityphysio.ie.** It is a concept, it is not clinically signed off, and its
contact form goes nowhere.
